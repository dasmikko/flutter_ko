### How do I install it?

You can do 3 things:

#### Get it from the F-droid repo (Recommended)
Download and install F-Droid, and add the IzzyOnDroid repository. Then you can install Knocky directly from there, and get updated via F-Droid

You can download F-Droid here: https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk

After installing it, add this repository: `https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo`

Search for Knocky, and install.

#### Installing it manually
All future updates will be available as releases here from Github, where you have to manually download them and install them.
NOTE: I am working on making the app able to tell you when there is a new version available, and update it inside the app.

#### Get it from Google Play (Not recommended)
The app is currently available on Google Play, but I wont update it as often anymore, as I have to keep being update on guidelines, and they can take it down without much notice.

## Where can I follow the development?
You can on Trello. There you can see my ideas, bugs and stuff in development.
